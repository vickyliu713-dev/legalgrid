        <p>
          If you’re starting a business in the UK, one of the earliest (and biggest) decisions is choosing your business structure. It affects <strong>tax, liability, fundraising, and even credibility with clients and investors</strong>. Get it right, and you’ve got solid foundations. Get it wrong, and you could face unnecessary tax bills or personal risk.

        <h3>Key Factors to Consider When Choosing</h3>
        <p>Ask yourself:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Risk</strong> – How much personal liability are you willing to take on?</li>
          <li><strong>Growth</strong> – Do you plan to raise investment or stay small?</li>
          <li><strong>Tax</strong> – Would you prefer corporation tax or personal income tax?</li>
          <li><strong>Admin</strong> – Do you want to keep things simple, or can you handle more paperwork?</li>
          <li><strong>Perception</strong> – Some clients and investors take limited companies more seriously than sole traders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Not thinking ahead</strong>: Choosing sole trader because it’s simple, then struggling to raise funding.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring liability</strong>: Many new founders don’t realise personal assets are on the line as sole traders.</li>
          <li><strong>Skipping agreements</strong>: Partnerships without a written agreement often end in disputes.</li>
          <li><strong>Forgetting tax implications</strong>: The wrong structure could cost you thousands.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h3>Changing Business Structures Later On</h3>
        <p>
          You’re not stuck forever. Many businesses start as sole traders and later incorporate. Partnerships can also convert into LLPs or limited companies. The key is timing: make the move before you take on major risks or outside investment.
