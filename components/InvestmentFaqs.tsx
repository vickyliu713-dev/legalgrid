    q: "Why do I need tailored investment agreements?",
    a: "Generic templates often fail investor due diligence. A tailored agreement ensures the terms are clear, enforceable, and aligned with your fundraising goals.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help with convertible notes or ASAs?",
    a: "Yes. We prepare convertible loan notes, ASAs, and SAFEs, which allow you to raise capital quickly while deferring valuation discussions.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can investment documents be prepared?",
    a: "Most investment agreements are delivered within 3â€“5 working days. We also handle urgent requests where needed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you only work with early-stage startups?",
    a: "No. We also support SMEs raising growth funding, securing loans, or restructuring ownership.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does LegalGrid support fundraising?",
    a: "We prepare agreements that satisfy investors, protect founders, and provide the clarity needed for smooth funding rounds. Our documents are designed to withstand due diligence and avoid disputes later.",
